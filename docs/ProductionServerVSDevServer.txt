For production, an optimized build is created once and deploy that build
A development server, on the other hand, focues on the developer experience

We cant afford to build our app once, make changes, rebuild and so on

For production builds, a page will be pre-rendered once when we run the build command

In development mode, a page will be pre rendered or statically rendered for every request
