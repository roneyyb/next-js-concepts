Request memoization is a technique that deduplicates requests for the same data within a single render pass

This approcahe allows reuse of data in a React Component tree, prevents redundant networks calls and enhance performance

For the intitial request , data is fetched from an external source and the result is stored in the memory


Subsequent request for the same data within the same render pass retrive the result from the memory bypassing the need to make the request 
again

This optimization not only enhances performance but also simplifies data fetching within a component tree
When the same data is needed across different components in a route (e.g., in a Layout, Page, and multiple components), it eliminates the need to fetch data at the top of the tree and pass props between components
Instead, data can be fetched directly within the components that require it, without concerns about the performance implications of multiple network requests for the same data



Request memoization is a React feature, not specifically a Next.js feature
Memoization only applies to the GET method in fetch requests
Memoization only applies within the React Component tree. It does not extend to fetch requests in Route Handlers as they are not part of the React component tree
For cases where fetch is not suitable (e.g., some database clients, CMS clients, or GraphQL clients), you can use the React cache function to memoize functions
