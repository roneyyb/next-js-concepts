SErver componetn does not send their code to client.

Benefits of server component

Reduced Bundle Sizes

Server components do not send code to the client, allowing large dependecies to remain server side.

This benefits users with slower internet connections or less capable devices by eliminating the need to download, parse, and execute Javascript for these components

additionally, it removed the hydration step, speeding up apploading and interactions

- Direct Access to Server-side Resources
By having direct access to server-side resources like databases or file systems, Server Components enable efficient data fetching and rendering without needing additional client-side processing
Leveraging the server's computational power and proximity to data sources, they manage compute-intensive rendering tasks and send only interactive pieces of code to the client

- Enhanced Security

Server Components' exclusive server-side execution enhances security by keeping sensitive data and logic, including tokens and API keys, away from the client-sid

- Improved Data Fetching

Server Components enhance data fetching efficiency
Typically, when fetching data on the client-side using useEffect, a child component cannot begin loading its data until the parent component has finished loading its own
This sequential fetching of data often leads to poor performance
The main issue is not the round trips themselves, but that these round trips are made from the client to the server
Server Components enable applications to shift these sequential round trips to the server side
By moving this logic to the server, request latency is reduced, and overall performance is improved, eliminating client-server "waterfalls"

Benefits of Server Components
Caching
Create
Browse
Rendering on the server enables caching of the results, which can be reused in subsequent requests and across different users
This approach can significantly improve performance and reduce costs by minimizing the amount of rendering and data fetching required for each request


- Faster Initial Page Load and First Contentful Paint
- Sixth, Initial Page Load and First Contentful Paint (FCP) are significantly improved with Server Components
By generating HTML on the server, pages become immediately visible to users without the delay of downloading, parsing, and executing JavaScript
Improved SEQ
- Regarding Search Engine Optimization (SEO), the server-rendered HTML is fully
accessible to search engine bots, enhancing the indexability of your pages

- Efficient Streaming
Server Components allows the rendering process to be divided into manageable chunks, which are then streamed to the client as soon as they are ready
This approach allows users to start seeing parts of the page earlier, eliminating the need to wait for the entire page to finish rendering on the server
