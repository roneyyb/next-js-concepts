Drawbacks of CSR

SEO

Generating HTML that mainly contains a single div tag is not optimal for SEO, as it provide little content for search engine to index

Performance

Having the browser (the client) handle all the work, such as fetching data ,computing the UI, and making the HTML interactive, can slow things down.
User might see a blank screen or  loading spinner while the page loads.

Each new feature added to the application increasesn the size of the javascript bunlde, prolonging the wait time for user to see UI.
