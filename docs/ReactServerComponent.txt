RSC is a new architecture by React team, aiming to optimize for efficiency and interactivity.
Combines strengths of server and client environments for improved performance and load times.

Introducing dual component model in Next.js 14

Client components rendered on server for faster initial content loading
Server components optimized for specific server-side execution environments


RSC architecture allows for exclusive server-side operation

RSC allows access to browser-exclusive APIs like geolocation or local storage for specific use cases.
Server components do not send code to the client, benefiting users with slower internet connections by keeping large dependencies server-side.


Server Components in Next.js 14 provide efficient data fetching and execution, enhancing security and data fetching efficiency.

Server Components remove the hydration step, speeding up app loading and interaction, and provide direct access to server-side resources.
Server Components enhance security by keeping sensitive data and logic on the server side, and enhance data fetching efficiency.

Server Components enhance performance by shifting logic to server side

Request latency is reduced and overall performance is improved by eliminating client-side waterfalls.
Caching results on the server enables improved performance and reduced costs by minimizing rendering and data fetching.



React Server Components (RSC) improve rendering efficiency

RSC divides rendering into chunks for faster delivery to clients
RSC architecture combines server and client rendering for better user experience


React Server Components enhance app performance and user experience.

Server components run on the server, accessing data and preparing content, leading to faster app speed and less data for users to download.
Client components handle interactive parts in the user's browser, providing a fast initial load and making websites faster, more secure, and easier to use.

Next.js app router is based on RSC architecture
