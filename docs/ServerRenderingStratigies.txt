- Static Rendering

Static Rendering is a server rendering strategy where we generate HTML pages at the 
time of building the application

This approach allows the page to be build once, cached by CDN and serverd to the client almost instantly

This optimization also enables to share result of rendering work with different users, resulting in a significant performance boost of you application

Static rendering is user for blog pages, ecommerce product pages, and documentation and marketing pages 

How to Statically Render?

Static rendering is the default rendeirng strategy in the app router
All routes are automatically prepared at build times without additional setup

So basically when you run build command you get two values on is Size and other is First Load JS
so Size refers to asset downloaded when you navigate on client side and First Load JS refers to Size when you load page directly

Prefetching

Prefetching is a technique used to preload a route in the background before the user navigates to instantly
Router are automatically prefetched as they become visible in the user's viewport,
 wither when the page first loads or as it comes into view through scrolling

 For static routes, the entire route is prefetched and cached by default

When we load the homepage, Next.js prefetches te About and Dashboard routes, kepping them ready for instant navigation 

Static Rendering Summary
Static rendering is a strategy where the HTML is generated at build time
Along with the HTML, the RSC payload is created for each component, and JavaScript chunks are produced for client-side component hydration in the browser
If you navigate directly to a page route, the corresponding HTML file is serve
If you navigate to the route from a different one, the route is created on the c side using the RSC payload and JavaScript chunks, without any additional requests to the server

- Dynamic Rendering
Dynamic rendering is a server rendering strategy where routes are rendered for each user at request time.

It is usefull when route has data that is personalized to the user or contains information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL's search parameters

News websites, personalized e-commerce pages, and social media feeds are some examples where dynamic rendering is beneficial

How to Dynamically rendered
 During rendering, if a dynamic functiona is discovered, Next.js will switch to Dynamically rendering the whole route

 In next.js these dynamic functions are: cookies(), headers(), and search parameters

 Using any of there will opt th ewhole route into dynamic rendering at request time

- Streaming
