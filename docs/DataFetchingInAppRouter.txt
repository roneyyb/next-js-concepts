Data Fetchign in App router

App Router uses the React Server Component (RSC) architecture, 
which allows us to fetch data using either server ither server
components or client components

It's advantageous to fetch data using server component, as they
have direct access to server-side resources such as databases or file systems

This not only tps inter the server's computational power and proximity to data
resources for efficient data fetching and rendering but also minimizes the need 
for client-side processing

We will explore data fetching various configurations for caching, revalidating and optimizing data fetching

On the client side, data fetching is typically managed through third-party libraries such
as TanStack Query which offers its own robust APIs
