For individual data fetches, you can opt out of caching by setting the cache option to no-store

So basically if you use "no-store option then nextjs does not cache below requests as well where
no-store option is not given

You should use route level configuration for such purposes 
export const fetchCache = "default-cache"

Opting Out Of Caching
For individual data fetches, you can opt out of caching by setting the cache option to no-store
Once you specify the no-store option for a fetch request, subsequent fetch requests will also not be cached
By default, Next.js will cache fetch() requests that occur before any dynamic functions (cookies(), headers(), searchParams) are used and will not cache requests found after dynamic functions
