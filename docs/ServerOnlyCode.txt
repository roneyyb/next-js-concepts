Server-only Code
Certain code is intended to execute only on the server
You might have modules or functions that use multiple libraries, use environment variables, interact directly with a database, or process confidential information
Since JavaScript modules can be shared, it's possible for code that's meant only for the server to unintentionally end up in the client
If server-side code gets bundled into the client-side JavaScript, it could lead to a bloated bundle size, expose secret keys, database queries, and sensitive business logic
It is crucial to separate server-only code from client-side code to protect the application's security and integrity

server-only Package
Provide a build-time error if developers accidentally import one of these modules into a Client Component
