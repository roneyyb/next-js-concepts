1. Static Site Generation(SSG)
2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

SSG occurs at build time, when the application is deployed on the server. This results in pages 
that are already rendered and ready to serve. It is ideal for content that doesn't change often, like blog posts

SSR, on the other hand, renders pages on-demand in response to user requests. It is suitable for personalized content 
like social media feeds, where the HTML depends on the logged-in user


Server-Side Rendering (SSR) was a significant improvement over Client-Side
Rendering (CSR), providing faster initial page loads and better SEO
