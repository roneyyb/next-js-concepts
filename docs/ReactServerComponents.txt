React Server Component (RSC) represent new architecture designed by the React team

This approaches aims to leverage the strengths of both server and client environments, 
optimizing for efficiency, load times and interactivity.

The architecture introduces a dual-component model

- Client Components
- Server components


This distinction is not based on the functionality of the components but rather on where
they execute and the specific environments they are designed to interact with
