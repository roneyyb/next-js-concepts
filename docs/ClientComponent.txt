Client Components
Client Components are the familiar React components we've been using
They are typically rendered on the client-side (CSR) but, they can also be rendered to HTML on the server (SSR), allowing users to immediately see the page's HTML content rather than a blank screen
Components that primarily run on the client but can (and should) also be executed once on the server as an optimization strategy

Client Components contd.
Client Components have access to the client environment, such as the browser, allowing them to use state, effects, and event listeners to handle interactivity and also access browser-exclusive APIs like geolocation or localStorage, allowing you to build Ul for specific use cases
In fact, the term "Client Component" doesn't signify anything new; it simply helps differentiate these components from the newly introduced Server Components
